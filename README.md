This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## You can see live demo at:

Data is created in Contentful and pulled from there.
If you want to see your own contentful data, you should replace your Api_Space and Access_Token with process.env.REACT_APP_API_SPACE and process.env.REACT_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN Contentful.js before start the app.

If you want to see just local data, delete "...external_items" in line 35.
